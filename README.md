## Week 1
On our first day of lecture, the class had discussed about Propositions. A proposition is a declarative statement that should be either true or false. Propositions have different operations as well.

These are: (example, let p and q be propositions)
- Negation     - opposite of the statement, "p," therefore, it is read as "not p"
- Conjunction  - it is "p ∧ q," read as "p and q," and is only true when both p and q are true.
- Disjunction  - it is "p ∨ q," read as "p or q," and is only false when both p and q are false. This is also called as "inclusive or"
- Exclusive Or - the exclusive or of p and q is only true when exactly one of them is true.

Moreover, we had discussed Conditional Statements which shows "if p then(→) q" and it is only false when p is true and q is false.
There are also different conditional statements formed from "p → q."

These are:
- Converse        : q → p
- Contrapositive  : ¬q → ¬p
- Inverse         : ¬p → ¬q

Biconditional Statements are shown as "p ↔ q" and is true when both p → q and q → p are true.

Afterwards, we answered some exercises from the reference book regarding the said lecture today. Since it was in alphabetical order, the loop started with my surname. I had managed to answer most questions every time it's my turn. As far as I remember, I had answered letters a and h from number 8, letter d from number 21, letter b from number 27 and almost got the right answers for letter e from number 15 and letter d from number 29.
